I am struggling for the same issue and removed the PROVIDES because
they are not correct any more: for omap3 we need mesa-gl as PROVIDER
for libgl. Same for virtual/mesa.

But still: Seems something is broken with virtual/libgl*. I working on
a bsp-layer [1] and maybe I did something wrong there but building
virtual/libgles2 builds mesa whatever I try...
