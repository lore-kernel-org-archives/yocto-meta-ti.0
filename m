We have been discussing this topic past couple days here:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.distributions.angstrom.devel/6260/focus=6274

Moreover, bitbake-devel is probably the wrongest list for this discussion or 
patch. I'm copying other related lists, but probably the main one should be 
openembedded-core, as the patch tries to fix it's package_ipk class...

And your analysis seems correct, as the grep matches the patch names of 
beaglebone kernel from meta-ti.

Actually, it does not depend on the verbosity/debug level, as it controls the 
output on the console and not in the log.do_rootfs file.

I don't think this part is really necessary - you always know which packaging 
system you use, so ipk/deb/rpm_log_check is rather easily identifiable...

So, this changes the regular expression to look for ^ERR and ^Fail at the 
beginning of the line...

While the change should fix this particular issue, I'm also worried about 
increasing chances of missing the actual errors when they don't start with ERR 
and Fail at the beginning of the line.

Either way, you may want to resubmit the cleaned up patch to openembedded-core 
list for other to comment.

P.S. Sorry for somewhat excessive cross-posting.
