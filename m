This is on my to do for next year to try to document expected release dates.

Sorry for all the confusion. I created those additional configs for our 
internal SDK consumers.

The official release will be 07.01.00.006 and I will be pushing that 
config shortly.

Yes I understand the issue with the PVR modules and kernel dependencies.

The Sancloud BSP layer (meta-sancloud) depends on both meta-arago and
meta-ti. For our Arago builds I typically pin release versions of
these dependency layers, especially for meta-arago and meta-ti I want
to ensure that we're using known good versions. The tag we're
currently pinned to is 07.00.00.005 which I believe corresponds to a
TI CoreSDK release. I see there are some new tags in these layers and
in the ti-linux-kernel repository

I also see that configs have been added to the oe-layersetup
repository which is usually my flag that something has been released.
However, in oe-layersetup both 07.01.00.004 and 07.01.00.005 have been
given config files while the meta-arago layer, meta-ti layer and
ti-linux-kernel recipes are up to 07.01.00.006. So my usual heuristics
are a bit confused.

I've tried searching for "ti coresdk" in google but I can't find any
documentation for this. I've also tried looking at the Arago wiki but
this does not look to have been updated recently. The only list of
branches I can find is
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://arago-project.org/wiki/index.php/Setting_Up_Build_Environment">http://arago-project.org/wiki/index.php/Setting_Up_Build_Environment</a>
which is definitely obsolete.

So all I can do is ask the question then - how do I find out when a
release of Arago (or TI CoreSDK) is ready to pick up and use?</pre>

To pre-empt the obvious question - we do test with the HEAD of the
dunfell branch of layers regularly but we're not happy to issue a
release of our own BSP without ensuring we're aligned on released
versions of the underlying layers where possible. We need to track the
releases in the ti-linux-kernel layer as we've seen in the past that
our kernel needs to match with the expectations of the meta-ti layer
if we want the PowerVR drivers to work.
